Android Quiz 1 
==============

Create Android project Quiz1Garage.

Your app will have two Activities: MainActivity and AddCarActivity.
Additional classes: Globals, Car.

Class Car
---------

class Car {
String makeModel;
int odometer; // in thousands of kilometers 0 - 500
int yearOfProduction; // integer 1900-2100
BodyType bodyType; // Enum { Van, Coupe, Convertible, FullSize, Compact }
boolean isElectric;

public String serialize() throws IOException {}
public deserialize(String data) throws IOException {}
}


Class Globals
-------------

class Globals {
public static final ArrayList<Car> carList = new ArrayList<>();
public static saveData(Context context) throws IOException {}
public static loadData(Context context) throws IOException {}
}


MainActivity
------------

MainActivity will have one main content - ListView, like we did in class.
It will also have a menu with always-visible item "Add" in right top corner.
No long click and no regular click is handled, only Add.


Notes
-----

Follow best practices of Java programming and Android programming you learned about so far, such as creation and naming of bindings, using constraints in UI, etc.

When handling exceptions and other errors you must properly propagate and handle the exeption, and inform the user using Toast if appropriate.

There are NO Dialogs in this app.

You must Log.d() major events, and Log.wtf() fatal problems.

Your app must loadData when started and saveData after every change, meaning:
- in MainActivity.onStart() you must call loadData()
- in AddCarActivity after you add Car to Globals.carsList you must saveData()

What to submit
--------------

ZIP file of your entire project.
